# LibraryWebApplication
I have developed a library web application named "Maximus" as a part of my Master's degree project. While I acknowledge that the application has room for improvement, I am content to publish it as evidence of my programming skills. Specifically, the display interface for the book dataset could be more efficient, and the system for charging users who return books late needs refinement, among other areas that require attention.

However, I am satisfied to make the application publicly available as it serves as evidence of my growth and progress in programming.
